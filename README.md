# Boomerang

I built this app because I wanted a super simple way to remind my future self of ideas I had the in the past.

I use it like this: any time I have an idea I want to process in the future, I click on the menu bar icon -> "Log New Idea", and write it down, as well as when I want to remember it.

Every day (or every few days), I click menu bar icon -> Bring it back" and process all those ideas that my *past* self wanted my *current* self to know. For each one, I decide to either edit it, delete it, or move it to the future.

Ideas are stored in plaintext on the disk so they can easily be read, copied, etc. You choose what folder they're stored in from menu bar icon -> Options.

## Installation

1. Install dependencies:
   ```
   pip install pyside6
   ```

2. Run the app:
   ```
   python main.py
   ```

3. If you want a systemwide shortcut, add this rule to Karabiner:
```
    {
        "description": "Alt-Shift-L â†’ Log new idea in Boomerang",
        "manipulators": [
        {
            "type": "basic",
            "from": {
            "key_code": "l",
            "modifiers": {
                "mandatory": ["left_shift", "left_option"]
            }
            },
            "to": [
            {
                "shell_command": "/path/to/bin/python /path/to/boomerang_hotkey.py log"
            }
            ]
        }
        ]
    }
```
